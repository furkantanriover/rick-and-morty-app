# Case Study Seven Apps

This project is a comprehensive case study for seven different mobile applications built using React Native and Expo. One of the applications included in this case study is a Rick and Morty character explorer. This application fetches data from the Rick and Morty API, displays a list of characters, and allows users to filter characters based on their selection using a MultipleSelect component.

## Description

The Rick and Morty character explorer is designed to showcase how to fetch and display data from an external API in a React Native application. Key features include:

- Fetching data from the Rick and Morty API.
- Displaying a list of characters with their details such as name, status, and origin.
- Implementing a MultipleSelect component to filter characters based on user selection.
- Providing a responsive and smooth user experience with animations and skeleton loaders while data is being fetched.

## Features

- **React Native**: Mobile application development framework.
- **Expo**: A platform for making universal React applications.
- **Navigation**: Implemented using `@react-navigation` and its various packages.
- **State Management**: Using `@tanstack/react-query` for server-state synchronization.
- **Styling**: Styled with `nativewind` and `tailwindcss`.
- **API Integration**: Axios is used for making API requests.
- **Reanimated Animations**: Smooth animations using `react-native-reanimated`.
- **Content Loader**: Placeholder skeleton screens using `react-content-loader`.
